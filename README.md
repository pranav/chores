chores
======

Because we're CS people, we obviously need to build a service for rotating
chores.

We start at week 0, and keep incrementing number of weeks. Week "w" mod 5 will
tell us which chore is assigned to who.

| Name        | Modulus |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Josh        | 0       |
| Spencer     | 1       |
| Pranav      | 2       |
| Richard     | 3       |
| Jonathan    | 4       |

| Chore    | Modulus |
| -------- | ------- |
| Nothing! | 0       |
| Trash    | 1       |
| Kitchen  | 2       |
| Bathroom | 3       |
| General  | 4       |
